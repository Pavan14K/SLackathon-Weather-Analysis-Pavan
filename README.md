## Short description
### What's the problem?
Rainfall occurs during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons, and high intensity storms that occur during the monsoon season cause heavy discharges in all rivers. As a result, a few states in India suffered massive human loss, as did many other similar events around the world that are uncontrollable, but we can save people, land, and property from these events. Also In terms of economy and environment, our daily lives are directly or indirectly influenced by the weather, which affects us through a variety of factors such as events, timing, duration, location, and so on.

### How can technology help?
Weather analysis and forecasting is a scientific and technological application that predicts the atmospheric conditions for an upcoming point in time and a given location.

### The Idea
Training the Machine Learning model to predict future weather conditions based on past weather data at a specific location, so that people and farmers can be informed about the weather conditions in the coming days. So that necessary safety precautions can be planned in order to save human life losses, improve crop yields, and avoid economic losses due to unexpected events.
